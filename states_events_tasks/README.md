## List of states, events, and tasks to be handled by real-time software

This will capture the list of states a scanner can be in, series of events on
the scanner console that can indicate changes between states, and the tasks to
be driven by the real-time software as a result of the state a scanner is in,
or the states it switches between.

A potential state diagram for typical MR scanner operation might look something
like this:

## List of more specialized states to detect, or applications to trigger:

1. Performing QA scans.

1. Automatic capture of physiology data. BIOPAC 'integration' (FNIRS, GSR)?

1. Motion detection and alert user if motion > set threshold.

1. Triggering other software coincident with data acquisition (e.g. for
   neurofeedback).

1. Custom reconstruction of data, with data either going back to scanner in a
   standard vendor-recognized format (e.g. DICOMs on GE, pixel database on
   Siemens), or sent to another application directly (e.g. 2D+z+t data to AFNI
   via real-time channel).

1. Drive actions based on pulse sequence/scan properties and/or parameter
   values (by reading "HEADER_POOL" on GE, and XProtocol on Siemens?).
   Real-time access to TWIX?  Access at scanner "prepped" state.

1. Adaptive experiments (e.g. staircases) - change/update acquisition/experiment
   based on parameter estimation of parameters.

1. In-session registration of partial brain volume data.  Grab images generated
   by scanner, or potentially doing your own reconstruction.

1. Detect and respond by acquisition-by-acquisition or TR-by-TR?

1. Sync other "real-time" data to FMRIF Scientific database (soon, to be XNAT)
   for data that is not part of DICOM (physio, log files, scanner calibration
   files, NIFTI data, etc.)

1. Integration with other hardware (e.g. trigger external cameras, hardware,
   keyboards, response box, RS-232 and DB-9 signal monitoring and recording),
   eye-tracker integration / triggering, EEG integration / triggering.

1. At end of scan, all data should be in AFNI/NIFTI - allow QA and further
   post-processing.

1. Set up physical and logical access for plugging in users' computers to
   allow their experiment to be run if integration.

1. Complete dump/record of scan parameters for any given run or experiment.

1. If available - access vendors' "peak detection" from physiological data,
   and save.

1. How to handle intricate "pre-scan" situations (reference scans for GE EPI
   scans, NIH EPI sequence on Siemens with integrated FLASH reference scan,
   CMRR multi-band EPI sequence).  Most likely all of these are caught as part
   of the system's pre-scan.  Also potentially integrated EPI reference scans,
   and EPI blip-up/blip-down corrections.
